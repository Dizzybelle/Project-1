Project Title: Assessing Crash Data from Montgomery County Maryland
Team members: Jules Gikundiro, Isabelle Scrimsher, Matthew Pedroza, Tia Chesley, Brian Fitzpatrick

For our project we analyzed vehicle accident data from Montgomery County Maryland. The dataset we used is 
called “Crash Reporting – Drivers Data”, we downloaded the csv file for the data at 
(https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crash-reporting-drivers-data).

The dataset is structured with each vehicle that was in an accident in a row, and a unique identifier for 
each accident. The date range for the data is from 2005 January 1 to 2023 November 1. The dataset 
includes the details of each accident with information such as the vehicle make, if the driver was at fault, 
the time of day the accident occurred, the speed limit, and if the driver was distracted. We had five 
questioned that we asked, with each member of the group answering a different question. Because of 
the format of the data, each group member cleaned the part of the data that they were using. The five 
questions we answered are, 
      What make of car is most likely to get into a crash?
      What percent was the driver at fault?
      What time of day do the most crashes occur?
      Do more injuries occur when the speed limit is higher?
      Is there a time of day when drivers are more distracted?
